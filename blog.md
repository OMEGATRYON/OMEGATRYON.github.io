Stressful project
>After about 7 hours since starting the major project we will be presenting for demo on friday, I had finally finished. I feel like i failed in a way as most of my situation was attempting to google things, fortunately i had a few AHA moments that took me for a Serotonin ride. One of those moments was when i had put all four images into one box to the side of my page. I'd rate this project a 10/10.

Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
>My first week was not what i expected, I had this thought that it would be really rushed to cram everything we need to learn super fast into our heads. So far it has been the opposite of that.

What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
>Honestly, all of it. i enjoyed this enough to join a bootcamp and learn about it all, every language and what it brings to the table has me intrigued! 

What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
>I would say anyone could see that I am very passionate about what we are doing, most nights it is hard to even go to bed without being excited to wake up the next day and just get at it! its a wonderful feeling.

My setup! for this bootcamp is pretty cool!

Every bit of code is important to a project, but if i had to pick the most fun i've had with some.
`#para1 {color: yellow;  background-color: blue; font-style: oblique,`
honestly anything with CSS! styling is pretty fun.
