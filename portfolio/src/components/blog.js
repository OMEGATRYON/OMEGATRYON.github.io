    <strong>
      What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in
      the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      To me it is awesome(inc)! It has changed how i perceive websites i
      personally visit. Opening a new website and seeing all of the content
      exposed on it has me crying internally, just knowing the pain the
      developer had to go through putting it together.

  <p>
    <strong>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      At the moment i hate it. Not because it is ineffective but because i've
      only just started my developer journey and so I suck at it, once I get a
      hold of it and make it useful! sure! im sure our relationship will change.

    <strong>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      JAVASCRIPT!!!! for the life of me i cannot at this current time grasp it.
      Putting pieces together just do not click for me, its almost as if im
      reading another language(technically it is!). Its honestly just scary,
      trying to succeed and not knowing when it will make sense.

  <p>
    <strong>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      Put one foot in front of the other. Thats it really plain and simple,
      trying to get into this career has been the most difficult challenge for
      me yet and without staying hopeful toward my goals and walking that extra
      step I would have fallen day 1.{" "}

    <strong>Javascript/pseudocode</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      The coding portion is really starting to kick off, after learning about
      javascript my head was spinning. It can be alot to take in, in such a
      short time BUT in the end the goal is worth it. The only simple solution
      to any of these problems would to be, Put one foot in front of the other
      and read along the way.

    <strong>Stressful project</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      After about 7 hours since starting the major project we will be presenting
      for demo on friday, I had finally finished. I feel like i failed in a way
      as most of my situation was attempting to google things, fortunately i had
      a few AHA moments that took me for a Serotonin ride. One of those moments
      was when i had put all four images into one box to the side of my page.
      I'd rate this project a 10/10.{" "}

    <strong>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      Honestly, all of it. i enjoyed this enough to join a bootcamp and learn
      about it all, every language and what it brings to the table has me
      intrigued!{" "}

      What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      I would say anyone could see that I am very passionate about what we are
      doing, most nights it is hard to even go to bed without being excited to
      wake up the next day and just get at it! its a wonderful feeling.

    <strong>My setup! for this bootcamp is pretty cool!</strong>

      Every bit of code is important to a project, but if i had to pick the most
      fun i've had with some.
    </strong>
    <code>
      `#para1 {"{"}color: yellow; background-color: blue; font-style: oblique,`
    </code>
    honestly anything with CSS! styling is pretty fun.

  <strong>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    My first week was not what i expected, I had this thought that it would be
    really rushed to cram everything we need to learn super fast into our heads.
    So far it has been the opposite of that.
